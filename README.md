# Senior Enrichment Project

### The Premise
 Design a website for aircraft fanatics ðŸ¤“ and create a RESTful API that allows you to manage these aircrafts!


### The tools

Use at least Sequelize, Express, React, Redux, and React-Redux when creating this app. You can incorporate any additional libraries or tools you wish.


## Getting started

1. Fork and clone this repo
2. *Set the name of your project in `package.json`*. The skeleton intentionally ships with an invalid name.
3. `npm install`
4. Start the build and the application processes with: `npm run start:dev`
5. If you navigate to the URL you should see some UI already :) [We already have some connection code to get you started]
